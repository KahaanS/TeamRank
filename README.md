# TeamRank
A project I did for my Intro to Computer Programming class. We used google's PageRank algorithm to rank Premier League teams from 1993-2018.

The files are as follows:
- EPL_Set.csv: The data set of matches we used
- elo.py: An initial experiment using ELO ratings
- eigencalc.py: The actual code to calcuate the rank of each team using the eigenvector approximation method
- KahaanSHah_FinalProject.pdf: A full description and explanation of the project
